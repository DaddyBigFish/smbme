# smbme
### Find writeable folders deep within SMB.

# Description
This was developed to solve the issue when doing simple SMB enumeration of shares. Sometimes folders nested within a share are writable but all the tools I've used always seem to fail to report it since it only identifies if the share itself is writebale or readable. This is confusing, since there the share may still be inherently writable if a folder's ACL within the share has been set to allow write permissions. The tool 𝘀𝗺𝗯𝗺𝗲 essentially provides the solution for this. It gives the user a way to identify writeable subfolders deep within an SMB share. It essentially connects, verifies available shares that it can access, it enumerates deep into the folder structure, then it uses smbclient command showacl to read all of the folder's permissions to identify **SID: S-1-1-0 (Everyone)** and **Permissions: 0x1f01ff (Write)**.
